# ML: Hot or Cold

## What is this?
This is a machine learning model that classifies the sound of pouring water as hot or cold (given the arbitrary boundary that >100 degrees f is hot). This project is an attempt to use what I'm learning in Fast.ai's excellent MOOC, and was inspired by an [NPR piece](https://www.npr.org/2014/07/05/328842704/what-does-cold-sound-like) on the sound water makes when poured at different temperatures.

[Build log 1](Build-Log-1_Design.ipynb) has a more detailed project description.

## How to try the classifier:
Submit an audio clip of pouring water here: *website forthcoming*

Alternatively: clone this repo, and follow the steps used in [build log 3](Build-Log-3_Testing-The-Model.ipynb) to test data of your own.

## How does the model work?
Take a look at the build logs to find out!

[Build log 1](Build-Log-1_Design.ipynb) outlines a series of experiments done to choose a project architecture.

[Build log 2](Build-Log-2_More-Data.ipynb) fine-tunes the chosen experimental design into a working model.

Finally, [build log 3](Build-Log-3_Testing-The-Model.ipynb) tries out the model on some data the model has never seen before (not even for validation).
